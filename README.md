#### Get API Information

Go to `https://trello.com/app-key` and get *API key*, *API secret* and *token* from there.

Rename `.env-template` to `.env` and enter gathered API information.

#### Run Script

Create a virtual environment with Python 3 and run `main.py`.

Give your Trello board a fitting background image (hint: search for `balls`, not `juggling`).
